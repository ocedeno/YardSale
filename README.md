**Testing The App:**

* Download the project to your computer from this project page.
* Once the project is downloaded, open the .xcodeproj file from the folder.
* Run the project either using the iPhone simulator or your device. I recommend running the project on the latest iPhone device. It should be compiled with the latest version of Xcode.
